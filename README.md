# Reccomendations
It is reccomended to use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for this project to contain all required Python Package Index Packages.

The requirements can be located within `requirements.txt` and can be downloaded automatically using `pip install -r requirements.txt` within the project's directory.

For Windows users I'd also reccomend installing the ["Windows Terminal"](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&gl=GB&ocid=pdpshare) application from the microsoft store, as it can display the program with higher clarity.
